    description:
      "Developed Fronda, a mock single-page e-commerce frontend for selling houseplants using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I designed the full UI and interaction flow in Figma and implemented it step-by-stepâ€”translating prototypes into reusable React components, managing app state for product listings and a local-storage shopping cart, and iterating on responsive layouts, accessibility, and micro-interactions for a polished user experience. This project highlights my ability to move from visual design to production code, build component-driven architectures, and refine UX through iterative implementation.",

    description:
      "Language Learning Graphical Report is a comprehensive R Markdown analysis exploring how linguistic and personal backgrounds impact proficiency in Dutch as a second language. Using a dataset of over 50,000 learners, the project applies the scientific method to investigate key research questions about first-language effects, educational experience, and multilingual exposure. I performed data wrangling in R, implemented statistical comparisons, and created clear, interpretable visualizations with ggplot2 to reveal trends in language acquisition. This project demonstrates competency in data-driven research, reproducible reporting, and communicating insights through code-backed graphical analysis.",

      "Implemented an end-to-end RNN in Python using PyTorch primitives to perform sequence tagging on the CoNLL 2003 dataset. Built a custom dataset loader, activation functions, and RNN architecture from scratch, leveraging autograd for training. Validated the model using accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating strong conceptual and practical understanding of deep learning and sequence modeling.
